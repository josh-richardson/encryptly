                    <p class="lead">How does Encryptly work?</p>
                    <p>When you first sign up to Encryptly, a unique RSA public-private key pair is generated in your browser (not on our servers), which is used for key exchange for encrypting and decrypting messages. The public key is sent to our server and is freely available so that other users can contact you. The private key is encrypted using AES-256 with the password being the decryption key that you specify. This decryption key is never sent to us, and always stays on your computer after you enter it. Whenever you sign in, you are first authenticated with the server using your password. The encrypted version of your private key is then sent to your browser over SSL for decryption. Your messages will only be viewable if the decryption key for the private key is correct, and since this never leaves your browser, you can be sure that your messages are secure.</p>
